Real Estate use case

Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

The two datasets are given, housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv. We need to use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable "Price". Housing_test data contains all other factors except "Price", we need to predict that using the model which we develop and show the output of the predicted values in a csv file.


Here, I have solved the problem by applying random forest method which is best technique to get the lowest value of root mean square values for dependent numerical data in machine learning.
