The data in "Weddings.xlsx" (see the attachment) show wedding costs and different variables that are likely to affect it (attendance, the couple's income, age of the bride, etc.). Build a regression model to predict wedding costs from all other variables. Note the "Payor" column contains a categorical variable, which takes two values - "Bride's family" and "Groom's family". To use the variable in the regression model, you need to first convert it to a numerical variable, with 0 representing one category and 1 representing the other. Analyze residuals to confirm that the assumptions of linear regression are valid for this model.
Interpret and comment on the regression results: (1) What is the quality of the model? (2) Which predictor variables are the most important?
If a couple is planning a wedding for 175 guests, the couple's income is $100,000, the bride's age is 33, the payor is the Bride's family, how much should they budget?
