Implement code containing the following functions:
1. A function that takes a number and returns a list of its all possible factors (e.g., for 10, these are [1, 2, 5, 10]). Name this function "factors".
2. A function that takes a number and returns True if the number is prime and False if the number is not prime (reuse the previous function!). E.g., for 7 it should return True, for 8 it should return False. Name this function "is_prime".
3. A function that takes two numbers and returns their Highest Common Factor (e.g., for 12 and 18, it is 6). Name this function "hcf".
Make sure the functions in steps 2 and 3 use the function in step 1. At the same time, make sure that each function works on its own.
Add comments to each function, to document what it does, what are its arguments and return values.
Write the code to use the function, making sure that they return the expected output.
