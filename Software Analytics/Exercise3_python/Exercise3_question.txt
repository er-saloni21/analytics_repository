Below is a class called Dog that has the attributes age and name. Use this class to create three Dog instances, each instance with a different name and different age. Put the instances into a list. Write a function that takes a list of dogs and returns the instance with the greatest age. The output must be in this format: "The oldest dog is Rex, its age is 10 years old."

class Dog:
    
    def __init__(self, age, name):
        self.age = age
        self.name = name
