Write the code that:
1. Reads the contents of "aston.txt" (please see the attachment)
2. Finds all unique words from the file, that is, a list of all words that appeared at least once in the text. For example, in "This is a cat and this is a dog", the unique words are: "this", "is", "a", "cat", "and", "dog". For the purposes of this assignment, consider a word to be any sequence of characters between two whitespaces.
3. Prints them to a file called "unique_words.txt", sorted alphabetically
4. Finds the longest word in the file and prints it to the screen
Please use comments to specify what each line of your code does. Each line must be commented!
