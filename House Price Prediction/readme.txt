 		PROJECT SUMMARY  - House Market Case Study
	Statistical Analysis of a Real World Data Set- SW3 postcode

The model focuses on studying the house market for SW3 postcode of City of London. It is considering the properties which are on Sale. This summary focuses on predicting the house price of SW3 postcode based on various factors considering like No. of Bedrooms, No. of Bathrooms, No. of Stations, House types.

The project aims to draw the statistical model to depict the house price and identify the predictors which have significant effect on outcome of Price.
However, on looking at the parsimonious model, it is evident that only three predictor variables i.e No. of bedrooms, house type flat and house type studio plays significant role in depicting the house price.


As per my conclusion, Flat should be considered as the best choice as compared to other house types for selecting house in SW3 postcode but it should not be termed as a best model since the independent variables explains only 67.6% of the variation for the dependent variable i.e Price.
